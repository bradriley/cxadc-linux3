cxadc (CX - Analogue-Digital Converter)

cxadc is an alternative Linux driver for the Conexant CX2388x video capture chips used on many PCI TV cards and cheap PCIe (with 1x bridge chip) capture cards. It configures the CX2388x to capture raw 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned samples from the video input ports, allowing these cards to be used as a low-cost 28-54Mhz 10bit ADC for SDR and similar applications.

The regular cx88 driver in Linux provides support for capturing composite video, digital video, audio and the other normal features of these chips. You shouldn't load both drivers at the same time.

## Where to find current PCIe 1x CX23881 cards + notes

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003461248897.html - White Variation

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003092946304.html - Green Variation

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001286595482.html    - Blue Variation

Note 01: The CX chip variant with the least self-noise is the cx23883 mostly found on the White Variation card with most clean captures at the 6dB off and Digital Gain at 0-10.

Note 02: ASMedia PCI to PCIe 1x bridge chips may have support issues on some older PCH chipsets: Intel 3rd gen, for example. ITE chips don't appear to have this issue. All White cards purchased so far have used the ITE chip.

Note 03: Users can replace the crystal to allow additional sample rates. For reliable 40Mhz 8-bit & 20mhz 16-bit capture, the recommended crystal is the `ABLS2-40.000MHZ-D4YF-T`.

Note 04: Added cooling can provide stability more so with 40-54mhz crystal mods, but within 10Â° Celsius of room temperature is always preferable for silicone hardware but currently only 40mhz mods have been broadly viable in testing.

Note 05: For crystals over 54mhz it might be possible to use higher crystals with self temperature regulated isolated chamber models but this is still to have proper testing.

## List of tested working crystals:

## Scripted Commands

Check the `utils` folder and the associated readme for quicker and more simplified commands.

## Getting started

Create a directory that you wish to install into. In a Terminal, navigate to your directory and use the following to pull down the driver:

`git clone https://github.com/happycube/cxadc-linux3`

When updates are made, you can later use `git pull` to update your local copy.

Once files have been acquired then proceed to do the following:

Build and install the out-of-tree module:

    make && sudo make modules_install && sudo depmod -a

If you see the following error, ignore it:

    At main.c:160:
    - SSL error:02001002:system library:fopen:No such file or directory: ../crypto/bio/bss_file.c:69
    - SSL error:2006D080:BIO routines:BIO_new_file:no such file: ../crypto/bio/bss_file.c:76
    sign-file: certs/signing_key.pem: No such file or directory
    Warning: modules_install: missing 'System.map' file. Skipping depmod.

This error just means the module could not be signed. It will still be installed.

Install configuration files::

    sudo cp cxadc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
    sudo cp cxadc.conf /etc/modprobe.d

Now reboot and the modules will be loaded automatically. The device node will be called `/dev/cxadc0`. The default cx88 driver will be blacklisted by cxadc.conf.
Module parameters can also be configured in that file.

If there is an issue just re-load the CXADC module from the install directory via terminal

    sudo rmmod cxadc 
    make
    sudo make modules_install
    sudo depmod -a

`depmod -a` enables auto load on start-up

Build the level adjustment tool:

    gcc -o leveladj leveladj.c

Optionally, install PV to allow real-time monitoring of the runtime & datarate.

    sudo apt install pv

Note: When using a lower end system, if there is not enough system resources you may have dropped samples!

# Configuration

## Module Parameters

Most of these parameters (except `latency`) can be changed using sysfs
after the module has been loaded. Re-opening the device will update the
CX2388x's registers. If you wish to be able to change module parameters
as a regular users (e.g. without `sudo`), you need to run the command:

    sudo usermod -a -G root YourUbuntuUserName

NOTE: the above command adds your local user account to the `root` group,
and as such, elevates your general permissions level. If you don't like
the idea of this, you will need to use `sudo` to change mudule sysfs
parameters.

To change configuration open the terminal and use the following command to change driver config settings.

Note! use `cxvalues` to check your current configuration state at anytime.

X = Number Setting i.e  `0`  `1`  `2`  `3`  etc

Y = Parameter setting i.e `vmux` `level` etc

sudo echo X >/sys/module/cxadc/parameters/Y

Example: `sudo echo 1 >/sys/module/cxadc/parameters/vmux`

NOTE: Also see the utils folders for scripts to manipulate these values, sudo will be required unless you add your local user to the `root` group as mentoined above.

### `vmux` (0 to 3, default 2) select physical input to capture.

A typical TV card has a tuner, a composite input with RCA/BNC ports and S-Video inputs tied to three of these inputs; you may need to experiment. The quickest way is to attach a video signal and see a white flash on signal hook-up and change vmux until you get something.

### Commands to Check for Signal Burst

Creates a video preview of signal depending on RF type you will get an unstable video or just a white flash.

PAL:
`sudo ffplay -hide_banner -async 1 -f rawvideo -pixel_format gray8 -video_size 2291x625 -i /dev/cxadc0 -vf scale=1135x625,eq=gamma=0.5:contrast=1.5`

NTSC:
`sudo ffplay -hide_banner -async 1 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt gray8 -video_size 2275x525 -i /dev/cxadc0 -vf scale=910x525,eq=gamma=0.5:contrast=1.5`

### `audsel` (0 to 3, default none)

Some TV cards (e.g. the PixelView PlayTV Pro Ultra) have an external
multiplexer attached to the CX2388x's GPIO pins to select an audio
channel. If your card has one, you can select the input using this
parameter.

On the PlayTV Pro Ultra:
- `audsel=0`: tuner tv audio out?
- `audsel=1`: silence?
- `audsel=2`: FM stereo tuner out?
- `audsel=3`: audio in to audio out

### `latency` (0 to 255, default 255)

The PCI latency timer value for the device.

### `sixdb` (0 or 1, default 1)
Enables or disables a default 6db gain applied to the input signal (Disabling this can result in cleaner capture but may require an external amplifier)

`1` = On

`0` = Off

### `level` (0 to 31, default 16)

The fixed digital gain to be applied by the CX2388x

(`INT_VGA_VAL` in the datasheet).

Adjust to minimise clipping; `./leveladj` will do this
for you automatically.

### `tenxfsc` (0 to 2, 10 to 99, or 10022728 to "see below", default 0)

By default, cxadc captures at a rate of 8 x fsc (8 * 315 / 88 Mhz, approximately 28.6 MHz)

tenxfsc - Sets sampling rate of the ADC based on the crystal's native frequency

`0` = Native crystal frequency i.e 28MHz (default), 40, 50, 54, (Modifyed etc)

`1` = Native crystal frequency times 1.25

`2` = Native crystal frequency times ~1.4

With the Stock 28Mhz Crystal the modes are the following:

`0` = 28.6 MHz 8bit

`1` = 35.8 MHz 8bit

`2` = 40 MHz 8bit

Alternately, enter 2 digit values (like 20), that will then be
multiplied by 1,000,000 (so 20 = 20,000,000sps), with the caveat
that the lowest possible rate is a little more than 1/3 the actual
`HW Crystal` rate (HW crystal / 40 * 14). For stock 28.6mhz crystal,
this is about 10,022,728sps. For a 40mhz crystal card, the lowest
rate will be 14,000,000sps. The highest rate is capped at the
10fsc rate, or:  HW crystal / 8 * 10.

Full range sample values can also be entered: 14318181 for intance.
Again, the caveat is that the lowest possible rate is:
HW crystal / 40 * 14 and the highest allowed rate is:
HW crystal / 8 * 10.

Values outside the range will be converted to the lowest / highest
value appropriately. Higher rates may work, with the max rate depending
on individual card and cooling, but can cause system crash for others,
so are prevented by the driver code (increase at your own risk).

### `tenbit`  (0 or 1, default 0)

By default, cxadc captures unsigned 8-bit samples.

In mode 1, unsigned 16-bit mode, the data is resampled (down-converted) by 50%

`0` = 8xFsc 8-bit data mode (Raw Unsigned Data)

`1` = 4xFsc 16-bit data mode (Filtered Vertical Blanking Interval Data)

When in 16bit sample modes change to the following:

`14.3 MHz 16-bit` - Stock Card

`17.9 MHz 16-bit` - Stock Card

`20 MHz 16-bit` - Stock Card

### `crystal` (? - 54000000,  default 28636363)

The Mhz of the actual XTAL crystal affixed to the board. The stock
crystal is usually 28636363, but a 40mhz replacement crystal is easily
available and crystals as high as 54mhz have been shown to work (with
extra cooling required above 40mhz).  This value is ONLY used to compute
the sample rates entered for the tenxfsc parameters other than 0, 1, 2.

Note!

`40/20mhz modes` have a rare chance of working on stock cards its recommended to just replace the stock crystal with ABLS2-40.000MHZ-D4YF-T for more reliable results.

## Capture

Connect a signal to the input you've selected, and run `leveladj` to
adjust the gain automatically:

    ./leveladj

Open Terminal in the directory you wish to write the data and use the following example command capture 10 seconds of test samples:

    timeout 10s cat /dev/cxadc0 > output.raw

`cat` is recommended due to user issues with `dd`

Note: For use with VHS-Decode & LD-Decode projects, instead of `.raw` extension use `.u8` for 8-bit or `.u16` for 16-bit samples. This allows the software to correctly detect the type of data.

To use PV argument that enables datarate/runtime readout, modify command with `|pv >`. It will look like this when in use:

    cat /dev/cxadc0 |pv > output.raw
    0:00:04 [38.1MiB/s] [        <=>  

Use CTRL+C to manually stop capture.

`timeout 30s` at the start of the command will end the capture after 30 seconds; this can be adjusted to whatever the user wishes.

`sox -r 28636363` etc can be used to resample to the sample rate specified whereas cat/dd will just do whatever has been pre-defined by parameters set below.

Optional but **not optimal** due to risk of dropped samples: on-the-fly FLAC-compressed captures are possible with the following commands. Edit sample rates to match your cxadc configuration. (We use the actual sample rate divided by 1000, because tools can only handle kHz range, not MHz range. This is more of an "informational" flag than anything. It doesn't affect compression level.)

16-bit mode 

    sudo sox -r 14318 -b 16 -c 1 -e unsigned -t raw /dev/cxadc0 -t raw - | flac --fast -16 --sample-rate=14318 --sign=unsigned --channels=1 --endian=little --bps=16 --blocksize=65535 --lax -f - -o .flac

8-bit mode 

    sudo sox -r 28636 -b 8 -c 1 -e unsigned -t raw /dev/cxadc0 -t raw - | flac --fast -16 --sample-rate=28636 --sign=unsigned --channels=1 --endian=little --bps=8 --blocksize=65535 --lax -f - -o .flac
    
    
## Other Tips

### Change CXADC defaults

Defaults cxadc3-linux/cxadc.c file to have the defaults you like. at stock, it will look like this:

`static int latency = -1;` (leave this alone)

`static int audsel = -1;`

`static int vmux = 2;`

`static int level = 16;`

`static int tenbit;`

`static int tenxfsc;`

`static int sixdb = 1;`

`static int crystal = 28636363;`

But you could change it to:

`static int latency = -1;` (leave this alone)

`static int audsel = -1;`

`static int vmux = 1;`

`static int level = 0;`

`static int tenbit = 1;`

`static int tenxfsc = 1;`

`static int sixdb = 0;`

`static int crystal = 40000000;`

Then redo the make and sudo make modules_install commands. Then next reboot, it will come up with those settings as the default.

### Accessing registers directly from userspace

This can be done with the pcimem tool. Get it from here:

    https://github.com/billfarrow/pcimem

Build it with `make`. To use, consult `lspci` for the PCI address of
your card. This will be different depending on motherboard and slot.
Example output:

    03:00.0 Multimedia video controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder (rev 05)
    03:00.4 Multimedia controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder [IR Port] (rev 05)

Here we want the video controller at address `03:00.0` - not the
IR port. Next you need to find that device in sysfs. Due to topology
it can be nested under other devices. The quickest way to find it:

    find /sys/devices -iname '*03:00.0'

Output:

    /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.5/0000:02:00.0/0000:03:00.0

To use pcimem we take that filename and add "/resource0" to the end.
Then to read a register we do this:

    ./pcimem /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.5/0000:02:00.0/0000:03:00.0/resource0 0x2f0000

0x2f0000 is the device ID register and it should begin with 0x88.
Output:

    0x2F0000: 0x880014F1

To write to a register, specify a value after the address.

## History

### 2005-09-25 - v0.2

cxadc was originally written by Hew How Chee (<how_chee@yahoo.com>).
See [SDR using a CX2388x TV+FM card](http://web.archive.org/web/20091027150612/http://geocities.com/how_chee/cx23881fc6.htm) for more details.

- added support for i2c, use `i2c.c` to tune
- set registers to lower gain
- set registers so that no signal is nearer to sample value 128
- added `vmux` and `audsel` as params during driver loading
  (for 2nd IF hardware modification, load driver using `vmux=2`).
  By default `audsel=2` is to route tv tuner audio signal to
  audio out of TV card, `vmux=1` to use the signal from video in of tv card.

### 2007-03-24 - v0.3

- change code to compile and run in kernel 2.6.18 (Fedora Core 6)
  for Intel 32 bit single processor only
- clean up mess in version 0.2 code

### 2013-12-18 - v0.4

This version has been retargeted for Ubuntu 13.10 Linux 3.11 by
Chad Page (<Chad.Page@gmail.com>).

While still a mess, the driver has been simplified a bit.  Data is now read
using standard `read()` semantics, so no capture program is needed like the original
version.

For the first time, it also runs on 64-bit Linux, and *seems* to be OK under
SMP.

### 2019-06-09 - v0.5

- Update to work with Linux 5.1; older versions should still work.
- Tidy up the code to get rid of most of the warnings from checkpatch,
  and bring it closer in style to the normal cx88 driver.
- Make `audsel` optional.
- Don't allow `/dev/cxadc` to be opened multiple times.
- When unloading cxadc, reset the AGC registers to their default values.
  as cx88 expects. This lets you switch between cxadc and cx88 without
  rebooting.
